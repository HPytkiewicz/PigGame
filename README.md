Simple game created during JavaScript course

Rules:
Each player can roll dice until they hold or roll 1. Whenever a player rolls, the roll value is added to his current score.
If he holds, his current score becomes permanent, and it becomes his enemy's turn. If you roll 1, it also becomes your enemy's turn,
but you lose all progress made in your current turn. Player who first gets 100 or more points wins!
